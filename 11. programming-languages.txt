C#

C#(pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming 
language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, 
functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and 
component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed
by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a 
standard by ECMA and ISO. C# is one of the programming languages 
designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

C++

It is designed with a bias toward system programming (e.g., for 
use in embedded systems or operating system kernels), with 
performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design 
requirements. C++ has also been found useful in many other 
contexts, including desktop applications, servers , 
performance-critical applications and entertainment software.

Java

Java is a functional computer programming language that is 
concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically 
designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
It is intended to let application developers "write once, run 
anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does
 not need to be recompiled to run on another.

JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most
commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow
client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the
browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document 
content that is displayed. It is also used in server-side 
network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game
development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.

PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web 
development but also used as a general-purpose programming 
language. As of January 2013, PHP was installed on more than
240 million websites (39% of those sampled) and 2.1 million web 
servers. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the 
reference implementation of PHP (powered by the Zend Engine) is 
now produced by The PHP Group.
